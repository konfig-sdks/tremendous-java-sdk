        ### Funding sources

        There are different ways to pay for gift cards and rewards on Tremendous. Every payment mechanism is called a "funding source".

        You can retrieve a list of all available funding sources by using the [Funding sources API endpoint](https://tremendous.readme.io/reference/core-funding-source-index).

        The Tremendous API sandbox environment comes with a single funding source that allows you to spend up to $5,000 in *fake money* to test the API. [Learn more about the sandbox environment](https://tremendous.readme.io/reference/sandbox).

        The HTTP status code `200` on the response will be used to indicate success.

        After processing successfully the reward gets queued to be delivered to it's recipient
        (for delivery method `EMAIL` and `PHONE`). Delivery will happen asynchronously, after the response
        has been sent.

        ### Idempotence

        Requests issued with the same external_id are idempotent.

        Submitting an order with an already existing `external_id`, will result in a `201` response code.
        In this case the response will return a representation of the already existing order in the response body.

        Organizations are a way to separate different parts of your business within the same Tremendous account.

        You can assign users in your Tremendous team as members to any organization. Users can be members of multiple organizations at once.

        API keys belong to a single organization. The API key used in a request determines on behalf of which organization the request is carried out.

        **Important note:** When creating an organization, you are required to either pass `with_api_key` or `copy_settings[user]` in the request body as `true`. This ensures that your new Organization can either be accessed via the API or the Dashboard.

        Each organization has one or more users that can access and manage that organization. These users are called members.

        Members can take actions via the Tremendous web dashboard directly. These actions include adding funding sources to the organization, creating Campaigns, and more.

        ### Permissions

        Members can have one of two roles that determine their permissions within the organization:

        1. `MEMBER`: Limited permissions. Can view their own reward and order histories only.
        2. `ADMIN`: Update organization settings, invite other members to the organization, and view all member order and reward histories within their organization.

        To create members of a sub-organizations [create an API key for that organization](https://developers.tremendous.com/) first, then use the new API key in the create member request.

        ### Inviting new members

        After creating a member, an automatic invite is sent to the email address. If the user is not registered yet, that person will then need to sign up for a Tremendous account.

        > ❗️ Automatic invitations are not available in the sandbox
        >
        > You must manually use the returned `invite_url` field in the payload instead.

        Every organization can define a single webhook endpoint where we send requests to, whenever an event happens.

        This endpoint allows you to setup that endpoint. The URL of the endpoint can be changed by making a request to this endpoint again with the new URL.

                      When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
                      after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
                      initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
                      **fail** to create any further orders.

                      It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

                      When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
                      after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
                      initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
                      **fail** to create any further orders.

                      It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`

            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            Reference for this order, supplied by the customer.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

        external_id:
          description: |
            Reference for this order, supplied by the customer.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

            Reference for this order, supplied by the customer.

            When set, `external_id` makes order idempotent. All requests that use the same `external_id`
            after the initial order creation, will result in a response that returns the data of the
            initially created order. The response will have a `201` response code. These responses
            **fail** to create any further orders.

            It also allows for retrieving by `external_id` instead of `id` only.

        Organizations are a way to separate different parts of your business within the same Tremendous account.
        Your root Tremendous account is an organization itself and can have multiple sub-organizations.

        You can assign users in your Tremendous team as members to any organization. Users can be members of multiple
        organizations at once.

        Each organizations can have it's own API key.
